Mother Jones recently published a very interesting [article](http://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/05/schools-behavior-discipline-collaborative-proactive-solutions-ross-greene) that asks if everything we know about disciplining kids is wrong. As a father, this article really got me thinking. Since my son was born, I've gradually moved from looking forward to accepting the credit for the huge success my son will become to realizing I will more likely be the one to blame for everything that holds him back. 

I think my son is border-line hyperactive. I am convinced he does not have ADHD, but he is definitely a high-energy child. One of my biggest fears since he started school is that he would get a teacher that would not be able to cope with his energy level and who would try to push for medication. So far, we've been lucky, and his teachers have helped him learn self-control    

I try to stay semi-current on the latest science, such as what has been learned about the [stages of intellectual development](http://childdevelopmentinfo.com/child-development/piaget/) in children.
